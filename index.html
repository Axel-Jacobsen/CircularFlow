    <h2>Conformal Mapping for creating airfoils</h2>
    <b>It is easy to find aerodynamic lift around a cylinder; it is very difficult to find it (organically at least) around an airfoil. We can use something called a Joukowsky Transform to transform a cylinder to an airfoil. Since the Joukowsky Transform is a conformal mapping, we can use the same equation for lift as we can for the cylinder.</b>

    <h2>Taylor Couette flow</h2>
    <b>"No Slip" boundary conditions are boundary conditions which say that the relative velocity of the fluid next to a solid bounary is zero. For example, if a boat is moving through the water, the water molecules right beside the hull move with the boat. This boundary condition gives some interesting results, especially for viscous fluids. This program below models <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57IMufyoCnQ">this video</a></b>
